# Svelte(-rs)

An alternative implementation of the Svelte compiler, written in Rust. This is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for production use.

## Why?

Svelte is a great framework but the developer experience when trying to use Rust as a backend isn't that good. This project aims to improve that.

---

## Why _Should_ You Use This?

-   Improved compile times
-   Better interop with a Rust web server

More importantly,

## Why _Shouldn't_ You Use This?

-   _Very_ experimental
-   The large ecosystem of Svelte and Vite plugins can't be used
-   (For now) no support for vanilla JS scripts
